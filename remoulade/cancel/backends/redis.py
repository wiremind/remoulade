class RedisBackend(CancelBackend):
    """A cancel backend for Redis_.

    It uses a sorted set with the message_id as member and the timestamp of the addition as a score.
    We can check if message has been canceled if it belongs to the set.
    And on each message cancel we delete all the cancellations that are older than cancellation_ttl (ZREMRANGEBYSCORE).
    This prevents unlimited set growth.

    Parameters:
      cancellation_ttl(int): The minimal amount of seconds message cancellations
        should be kept in the backend.
      key(str): A string to serve as key for the sorted set.
      client(Redis): An optional client.  If this is passed,
        then all other parameters are ignored.
      url(str): An optional connection URL.  If both a URL and
        connection parameters are provided, the URL is used.
      **parameters(dict): Connection parameters are passed directly
        to :class:`redis.Redis`.
